### About this project:
This is a amazing project created with some codes and hard-workfull mentality, nothing else.  Combination of all fucntionlities are seems difficult, But was far easier than I think at first time. Anyway this is a `web-app` about `tours & travells`. You can visit on this web-app here: https://aventoura-b977d.web.app/ . But rememdber you cannot visit all routes because some routes are `privet-route`, you have to `login` first to visit. Dont worry about your information. Its `authenticated` with `google` and `git-hub` using `firebase` Thats it. All data using in this web app are hosted in `mongo db`. I used to make some api for `create`, `read`, `update`, and `delete` operation performs for the client side.

### Fuctionalities

In this web app, user can book desired location to visit the place. He/She can also withdraw his/her request to cancel the tour at the `My Plan's` tab.
